# Dual Channel Datalogging with Simple GUI

This Python script provides a pysimpleGUI-based interface for controlling the Keithley 2182A Nanovoltmeter using the instrcomms communication module. It allows users to configure measurement parameters, manage multiple channels, and plot the results in real-time using matplotlib.

The folder contains 2 files, the source code (DualChannel_DataLogging.py) and the GUI file (instrgui_2182a.py).
